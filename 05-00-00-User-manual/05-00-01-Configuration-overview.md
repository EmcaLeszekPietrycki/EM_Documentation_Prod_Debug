- Bulk delete objects

You can switch between object types using the **Object type menu** to view and configure related items. These shortcuts work consistently across all object types.

### Saving Configuration Changes and Viewing the Changelog

To save your configuration changes, click **Save** in the top bar of the configuration page. Energy Monitor usually saves most configuration objects to the configuration database, with some exceptions such as the Permissions section. Visual cues indicate when you need to save a configuration, as explained in the workflow below:

1. Click an object on the configuration page and make changes.
2. Click **Submit**.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 as needed.
4. Click **Save** in the top bar of the configuration page to save all your changes and those made by other users.

When there are unsaved changes, the number of unsaved changes appears next to the **Save** button, and details are displayed next to the objects with unsaved changes.

<blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid red; padding: 15px;"> <b>Note</b>: Users need export permissions to save changes.
</blockquote><br>

Additional actions you can perform:

- **Undo**: To revert all user changes since the last save, click **Undo**. This action provides the option to perform a complete reimport by clicking the displayed link.
- **Changelog**: View the history of all configuration changes by clicking **Changelog**. Filter the list of changes by clicking **Toggle filter bar** and entering details of users, objects, and dates. Users with limited permissions will only see changes on hosts and services for which they are contacts.

### Reusable Configuration

You can set up the following reusable configurations for use with other objects:

- Time periods
- Templates
- Commands

Energy Monitor comes with default reusable configurations for each of these types. You can either use these default settings, modify them, or create your own custom configurations.

### View active config

To view the details of the current configuration, select **Manage > View active config** from the menu. Use the **Object type** drop-down list to choose the specific object you wish to view.

You can view configurations for the following types:

- Hosts
- Services
- Host groups
- Service groups
- Contacts
- Contact groups
- Time periods
- Commands

To filter the displayed objects, enter a term in the filter field and click **Filter**. Additionally, you can click on links within the view to access details of related object configurations. For example, clicking a link in the **Host Check Command** column will take you to the related commands view.

### Commands and custom variables

You can define command lines and create custom variables when setting up configuration objects, including templates, hosts, services, and contacts.

### Configuration synchronization in distributed environment

In a distributed or load-balanced monitoring environment, Energy Monitorâ€™s Merlin back end manages the synchronization of configuration updates on the master server.

## Overseeing Hosts and Services

The following procedures outline how to add, update, and configure monitoring objects, including:

- Hosts and host groups
- Services and service groups

The sequence in which you create hosts, services, and their respective groups does not matter. For instance, you can add a host to an existing host group or create a new host group and then add a host to it. Additionally, a host can be added to multiple groups.

<blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid green; padding: 15px;"> <b>Note</b>: Configuration changes are not finalized until you click Save, which saves your changes to the Energy Monitor database. For more details, refer to Saving configuration changes and viewing the changelog in the Introduction to configuration.
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid red; padding: 15px;"> <b>Caution</b>: Using the user interface to configure Energy Monitor objects is the only supported method for updating object configurations in Energy Monitor. We do not support direct modifications to object configuration files. Energy Monitor uses Livestatus to parse configuration files, and manual changes to these files can cause conflicts with Livestatus data and API calls. However, advanced users can create custom configuration files.</blockquote>
