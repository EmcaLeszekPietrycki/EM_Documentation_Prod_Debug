# Adding Contacts/Services/Hosts to Groups

Energy Monitor supports the use of groups, which allow multiple hosts, services or contacts to be brought to together as 1 entry. 

Practical example, would be a situation where a company has a 100 Windows hosts, IT department has decided and configured the services and metrics to be monitored on those endpoints and now, instead of adding those metrics a 100 times, one host at a time, they can be added to a servicegroup and 100 windows endpoints to a host group. 

In the end, all IT department would have to do is assign the hosts to the host group and a servicegroup to hte hostgroup. 

## Adding Hosts to groups
