# Adding Hosts to Groups

Energy Monitor supports the use of groups, which allow multiple hosts, services or contacts to be brought to together as 1 entry. 

- Practical example, would be a situation where a company has a 100 Windows hosts, IT department has decided to sort them into groups for ease and convenience.

- Any changes to various parameters, like implementing metrics, can be controlled from the level of a group.
