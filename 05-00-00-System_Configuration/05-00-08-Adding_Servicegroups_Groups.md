# Adding Services to Groups

Energy Monitor supports the use of groups, which allow multiple hosts, services or contacts to be brought to together as 1 entry. 

- Practical example, would be a situation where a company has a 100 Windows hosts, IT department has decided and configured the services and metrics to be monitored on those endpoints and now, they would like to see multiple metrics/services from multiple hosts in 1 place.

- **Service groups cannot be assigned to hosts or hostgroups, that's by design.**

- **Their goal is to group services for visual purposes and notifications.**
